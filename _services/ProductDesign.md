With expertise rooted in a deep understanding of emotion, aesthetics, and user-centricity, I bring a visionary approach to crafting impactful and delightful experiences that resonate with users.

# Product Psychology

Product psychology is the study of how human behavior and psychology intersect with product design and user experience. Understanding product psychology allows designers to create products that resonate with users on a deeper level, resulting in increased user satisfaction, engagement, and ultimately, business success. Employers value product psychology knowledge as it enables designers to make informed decisions, effectively target user needs and preferences, and ultimately deliver products that drive user adoption and customer loyalty.

## Emotion as a key to success

Brands we love consist of product excellence, aspirational content, and emotion. Emotions as part of that concept ensure business survival by creating an obsession with the brand, quality, and products, not with a low price. 

How products and emotions are in relation to each other, as the following diagram shows.

![product emotion cycle](\images\services\product_emotion_cycle.PNG)

Designers must develop not only effective products but also enhance positive aspects of the user experience and limit or eliminate negative aspects of the user experience. Things to consider that impact most products:
    1. Remove Goal Obstacles
    2. Objects are the means, not the task itself
    3. Objects should behave as expected

In the design process, Don Norman's three levels of design (visceral, behavioral, and reflective) should be considered, too. The visceral level of design refers to the first impression of a design, both in terms of how the user perceives the product and how it makes the user feel. The behavioral level refers to the experience of the product in use. We often think of this level when we think of user experience. The reflective level refers to the user's reflections about the product, both before, during, and after use. The three levels all combine to form the entire product experience.

In the focus of my work are two emotions with increased importance because they help us to reach and match brand values. They are **trust** and **fun**. 

Another method I'm using in during the design processes is Marlows hierachy of needs. 
To achieve happiness, we must satisfy the needs after each, not missing one of them and starting at the bottom. There is also one for interaction design.

### Trust

Trust is important for the user experience. Especially for a product that deals with people's data, it has high priority. Trust is one of the most important aspects of e-commerce, especially; without trust, the users are not prepared to enter their details, let alone make a purchase. Therefore, images or text and any other elements that suggest or guarantee safety encourage the users to trust you and complete purchases as a direct result. Trust is part of the need safety which is on second position of Marlow hierachy of needs. 

 To build trust, I create aesthetically pleasing, consistent, and accessible UIs. 

**Aesthetics**
If you have ever wondered why your designer is bothering you with the correct usage of fonts, specific color codes, etc., that's because of the two following facts:
People enjoy the beauty. This means we are more likely to spend money on something that looks and feels good over conscious decision-making about functionality. If people on the streets are asked why they decided to buy the aesthetically pleasing product over the one with enhanced functionalities, there is a high chance to get the answer: "I like how it looks like."
But it's not only that what you designers drive. Software users have the unconscious connection between UIs they do enjoy to look and the trust for good functionality. Also, users are way more likely to excuse bugs when they like the look of the software. (True story.)

**Consistency**
Consistency is the secret sauce that brings harmony to the user experience. Imagine using a product where every button is a different shape, color, or size with no apparent reason. It would be like navigating a chaotic maze with no clear direction. Consistency in design elements, such as layouts, colors, typography, and interactions, creates a sense of familiarity and ease of use for users. By ensuring consistency throughout the UI, I establish a visual language that users can quickly understand and navigate, fostering a seamless and enjoyable experience.

**Accessibility**
Designing for accessibility is not just a nice-to-have, it's a must-have. It ensures that your product can be used and enjoyed by a diverse range of users, including those with disabilities or impairments. By considering accessibility in the design process, I prioritize inclusivity and equal access to information and functionalities. This involves providing alternative text for images, using clear and readable fonts, optimizing color contrast for readability, and incorporating assistive technologies like screen readers. By making my designs accessible, I enable a broader audience to engage with the product and have a positive user experience.


In the quest for building trust, captivating aesthetics, maintaining consistency, and prioritizing accessibility, I strive to create user experiences that not only look visually pleasing but also inspire confidence, engagement, and inclusivity. By understanding and implementing these key principles, I can lead teams to craft digital experiences that leave a lasting impression and keep users coming back for more.

### Fun

**Costumers just wanna have fun!**

If we want our project to work, it has to be fun.

Using our products shouldn't feel like extra work. The products should instead support the users, aiming to make work engaging and motivating. Therefore we need fun, and as a tool to create fun experiences, we will use **gamification**.

Gamification is not the same as game design, because it adds game-like elements to non-gaming environments. 

 Gamification doesn't mean including games in our product but using the essential part of games. Gamification is supposed to engage, motivate and delight an audience, and encourage them to do something more or better than they would have done in the past. When you build your gamification strategy upon understanding your players, the chances of getting something right are much higher than when you build a product based upon users.

In gamification, our users shift from *just being our users* to being our players. To design for our - now so-called players - we will use "player-centered design." The word “players” implies that participants in your gamification exercise are participating because they want to. The word “users” on the other hand implies that the person has no choice in taking part. As such, players are much more likely to have fun than users.
The player-centered design contains: 
    1. Know Your Player
    2. Identify The Mission
    3. Understand Human Motivation
    4. Apply Mechanics
    5. Manage, Monitor, and Measure

It needs a clear objective for any gamification exercise, and it should be as simple as possible. 

### Design is dynamic

The design will change by time. We won't just add components but we will go over all views again and again. The product hast to change visually to stay intresting and to represent growth.

## Design Management

Design management is the art of balancing creativity and business objectives. It involves overseeing the design process, nurturing the creative team, and aligning design efforts with strategic goals to drive successful outcomes. Effective design management requires a blend of leadership, communication, and a deep understanding of both design principles and business strategies.
