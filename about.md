I am a dynamic and visionary Product Design Lead known for cultivating a design team's success by harnessing the power of emotion. With a focus on building a safe and supportive work environment, I empower team members to thrive in autonomy, competence, and a sense of belonging (relatedness.) 

By fostering trust and collaboration, I am driving the evolution of products through a harmonious blend of aesthetics, consistency, accessibility, and an element of fun. With a deep understanding of the intricate interplay between emotion and design, I am dedicated to creating impactful and delightful user experiences. 

Connect with me to discover how the fusion of emotion and design can shape a brighter future.
